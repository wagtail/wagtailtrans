Welcome to wagtailtrans's documentation!
========================================

Wagtailtrans is a package that can be used to facilitate multi language sites in Wagtail.
We developed wagtailtrans with two implementations in mind.
A synchronised tree method and a freeform tree method.

Synchronised trees is a method used to keep the tree structure in all languages the same.
Any changes in the tree of the default language will also automatically be done in the language tree(s).

Freeform trees allows the customization of the language trees.
Pages can still be copied with content into the preferred language but this is not
automatic nor mandatory.
moderators can decide how the page structure works for every language.
