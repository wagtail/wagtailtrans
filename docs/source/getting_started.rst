Getting started
===============

To start using wagtailtrans in your project, take the following steps:


------------
Installation
------------

1. Install Wagtailtrans via ``pip``

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install wagtailtrans

2. Add ``wagtailtrans`` and ``wagtail.contrib.modeladmin`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'wagtail.contrib.modeladmin',
        'wagtailtrans',
        # ...
    ]

.. note::

    As of Wagtailtrans 1.0.3 the custom Language management views are replaced with with ``wagtail.contrib.modeladmin``
    This needs to be added to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` as well.


3. Add ``wagtailtrans.middleware.TranslationMiddleware`` to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``::

.. code-block:: python

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
        # ...
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        'wagtail.wagtailcore.middleware.SiteMiddleware',
        'wagtailtrans.middleware.TranslationMiddleware',
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        # ...
    ]

.. note::

    Keep in mind ``wagtailtrans.middleware.TranslationMiddleware`` is a replacement for ``django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware``.

.. note::

    It relies on ``wagtail.wagtailcore.middleware.SiteMiddleware``, which should come before it.
    See http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v1.8/getting_started/integrating_into_django.html#settings for more information.


4. Optionally, add ``WAGTAILTRANS_TEMPLATE_DIR`` to your ``TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']``

.. note::
    As of Wagtail 1.8 ``Page.get_admin_display_title`` is added which doesn't require overriding admin templates anymore, so if you're on Wagtail >= 1.8 you can skip this step.


.. code-block:: python

    from wagtailtrans import WAGTAILTRANS_TEMPLATE_DIR

    TEMPLATES = [{
        # ...
        'DIRS': [
            WAGTAILTRANS_TEMPLATE_DIR,
        ],
        # ...
    }]


-------------
Configuration
-------------

Before we start incorporating wagtailtrans in your project, you'll need to configure wagtailtrans for the behavior that best suits the need of your project. The required settings to consider here are:

 - ``WAGTAILTRANS_SYNC_TREE``
 - ``WAGTAILTRANS_LANGUAGES_PER_SITE``

Both settings are mandatory but provided with a default value, so if you want *synchronized* trees and no languages per site, you're good to go from here.

Incorporating
-------------

To start using wagtailtrans we first need to create a translation home page. This page will route the requests to the homepage in the right language. We can create a translation site root page by creating the ``wagtailtrans.models.TranslatableSiteRootPage`` as the first page under the root page.

In this example we will also make a ``HomePage`` which will be translatable. This is done by implementing the ``wagtailtrans.models.TranslatablePage`` next to Wagtail's ``Page``

.. code-block:: python

    from wagtail.wagtailcore.models import Page
    from wagtailtrans.models import TranslatablePage


    class HomePage(TranslatablePage, Page):
        body = RichTextField(blank=True, default="")
        image = models.ForeignKey('wagtailimages.Image', null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='+')

        content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
            FieldPanel('body'),
            ImageChooserPanel('image')
        ]

        subpage_types = [
            # Your subpage types.
        ]


This will create our first translatable page. To start using it we first need to migrate our database

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate


Now run the server and under the page ``Root`` create a ``TranslatableSiteRootPage`` (MySite).

Next we need to create a site and point it's ``root_page`` to our ``TranslatableSiteRootPage`` (MySite).

.. figure:: _static/site.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Create your site and select ``MySite`` as root page.

We now have the basics for a Translatable Site.
