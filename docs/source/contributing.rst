Contributing to Wagtailtrans
============================

Thank you for considering contributing to Wagtailtrans.

We appreciate all kinds of support, whether itâ€™s on bug reports, code,
documentation, tests or feature requests.

Issues
------

Our Github `issue tracker <https://github.com/LUKKIEN/wagtailtrans/issues>`_ is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests and submitting pull requests. When creating new issues please provide as much relevant context as possible. Even your detailed comments on existing issues are a big help.

Pull request
------------

You can contribute your code by creating a new pull request. If there are any open issues you think you can help with, you can discuss it on that specific issue and start working on it. If you have any idea for a new feature, please raise it as an issue. Once a core contributor has responded and is happy with your idea and the solution, you can start coding.

You should create your `own fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_ of `wagtailtrans`. We recommend you to create separate branches to keep all related changes within the same branch. Once you are done with your changes, you can submit a pull request for review.

**Please keep in mind**

* Any new feature must be documented.

* New features and bugfixes should have corresponding unit tests. They should be readable and test the correct things. For better code coverage, please make sure you cover as many lines of your code as possible within the unit tests.

* If you're not already on the list, add your name to `CONTRIBUTORS.md`.


Development
-----------

`wagtailtrans` made it very easy to setup a runnable Django project to help with the development. It ships with a Sandbox application that can be availed for this purpose. You need to have some additional packages installed and a PostgreSQL Database on your local machine.

* We suggest you use a *virtual environment* for development.

* Activate your virtual environment and install following packages.

.. code-block:: bash

    Django
    Wagtail
    psycopg2
    pytest
    pytest-cov
    pytest-django
    coverage
    factory-boy

* Set PostgreSQL Database Authentication parameters Host, User, and Password as environment variables.

.. code-block:: bash

    export POSTGRES_HOST=host
    export POSTGRES_USER=User
    export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password

* You can also set optional `POSTGRES_DB` variable. Otherwise, it will create a database named `wagtailtrans_sandbox`.  Make sure your database user has sufficient permission to create databases because `wagtailtrans` need to create a database for testing.

Testing
-------

We use `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ for unit testing. To execute the full testsuite, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    make qt

or for a specific file

.. code-block:: bash

    py.test path/to/file

If you want to measure test coverage you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    make coverage

Wagtailtrans supports multiple environments which can be tested with `tox`. It takes a bit longer to complete, but you can run it by a simple command:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox
