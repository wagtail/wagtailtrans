Freeform translation tree
*************************
Before you can start using freeform trees, please be sure you followed all the steps in: :ref:`getting_started`.

If you specified the `WAGTAILTRANS_SYNC_TREE` in your settings as `False` you will be using the freeform trees.
the freeform trees are used if you do not want to keep your language trees the same for all languages.
This enables the `translate into` button in the Wagtail admin.
This will show all the languages that the page can be translated into.

Once a language is selected you will be asked if you want to copy the content and where to move the page to.

With this setting your langauge tree structure is free for all languages.

The translator roles and groups will still be created as in the synchronized tree section.
