------------------------------
Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

In the progress of creating this release, we found out that some earlier design choices needed to be reworked in order to have a good maintainable package.


``include_self``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before wagtailtrans ``0.1.0b4`` the method ``TranslatablePage.get_translations`` implemented a ``kwarg`` to include itself in the QuerySet of translated pages. Since this isn't used within the wagtailtrans codebase we removed it because keeping it there made the codebase better maintainable.


``wagtailtrans.models.TranslatablePage.translatable_page_ptr``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of wagtailtrans 0.1 we've refactored the ``TranslatablePage`` model to have a custom parent_link, this way it's easier to migrate any existing Wagtail site for use with wagtailtrans. This is done by inheriting from ``TranslatablePage`` and ``Page`` for implementations of pages.

As for migrating, this is sadly not possible without some custom migrations, a way to do this is documented here: :ref:`migrating`
